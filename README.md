Skill frenzies added by submodules like [Dirtmole](https://github.com/RimCorePlus/Genes-Dirtmole) have a mild incompatibility with Enhanced Beliefs, which spams harmless red errors when joy is disabled for a human pawn.

## Changes
All changes are disabled by default.

### Remove vanilla xenotypes
All xenotypes except for sanguophage can be removed from pawn generation in a non-destructive way by removing them from every xenotypeChances list and setting factionlessGenerationWeight to 0. They can still be created by the character at game start and selected in the xenotype menu. Dirtmoles, genies, highmates, and hussars can be toggled off on an existing save. Removing impids, neanderthals, pigskins, wasters, and yttakin from an existing save is not advised if their factions are present.

Removing wasters will cause a harmless DefOf red error on startup.

### Misc changes
- Butchering Piggers Yields Pork
- Normal Body Piggers
