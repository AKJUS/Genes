# [CorePlus] Genes
![](About/Preview.png)\
[![GPLv3][badge-license]](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0) ![Supports Biotech][badge-dlc-biotech]

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Requires [Vanilla Expanded Framework](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2023507013).

Skill frenzies added by submodules like [Dirtmole](https://github.com/RimCorePlus/Genes-Dirtmole) have a mild incompatibility with Enhanced Beliefs, which spams harmless red errors when joy is disabled for a human pawn.

## Changes
All changes are disabled by default.

### Add taming and training buffs to animal genes
Self explanatory. Patched for AFU Cosmetic Gene Expanded.

### Rework skill aptitude genes
Great and awful skill genes now only offset the skill by 5 levels, down from 8. Strong and poor provide no skill offset, add or remove a passion, and are renamed to "{skill} interest" and {skill} apathy."

### Remove vanilla xenotypes
All xenotypes except for sanguophage can be removed from pawn generation in a non-destructive way by removing them from every xenotypeChances list and setting factionlessGenerationWeight to 0. They can still be created by the character at game start and selected in the xenotype menu.

Removing wasters will create a harmless red error.

### Misc changes
- Give sanguophage red eyes (more shades with EyeGenes2)
- Flatten gene complexity
- Flatten metabolic efficiency
