# gene expansion
![](About/Preview.png)

Scope of this mod:
- Add new genes to be used by my xenotype mods
- Rebalance existing xenotypes

Xenotypes added by other modders should be debloated/rebalanced by [fried rice](https://github.com/boomersama/boomer.patches) so any additional changes can be built upon by this mod.

## Additions
- Additional eye colors (currently violet, blue, and green)
- Always male and always female genes

## Changes
- Adds taming and training buffs to animal genes
- Removes all genetic aptitudes
- Removes dirtmole, genie, hussar, neanderthal, pigskin, and yttakin xenotypes
- Reworks highmate, impid, and wasters
- Gives sanguophage red eyes
- Flatten gene complexity (disabled by default)
- Flatten metabolic efficiency (disabled by default)
