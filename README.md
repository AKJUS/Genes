# [CorePlus] Genes
![](About/Preview.png)\
[![GPLv3][badge-license]](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0) ![Supports Biotech][badge-dlc-biotech]

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Requires [Vanilla Expanded Framework](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2023507013).
## New Genes
**Mining frenzy**
Increases sleep fall rate by 30%. and grants access to a new ability with the same name:
- Disables almost all needs (patched for RJW)
- Increases deep drilling speed, mining speed, move speed, and total mining skill by 5 for 6 hours
- Blocks sleeping and social interaction
- 24h cooldown
## Changes
All changes are toggable.
### Add taming and training buffs to animal genes
Self explanatory. Patched for AFU Cosmetic Gene Expanded.
### Rework skill aptitude genes
Great and awful skill genes now only offset the skill by 5 levels, down from 8. Strong and poor provide no skill offset, add or remove a passion, and are renamed to "{skill} interest" and {skill} apathy."
### Remove vanilla xenotypes
Genie, highmate, hussar, and neanderthals are removed from pawn generation in a non-destructive way by removing them from every xenotypeChances list and setting factionlessGenerationWeight to 0. They can still be created by the character at game start and selected in the xenotype menu.
### Rework vanilla xenotypes
These reworks are intended to make other xenotypes less of a pain in the ass to play against in raids or to keep in a regular colony.\
**Emphasized** genes are new. ~~Slashed~~ genes are removed.
