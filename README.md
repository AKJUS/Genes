## Additions
### Hair Color Genes
This mod adds 63 hair colors from the RimWorld color palette. By default, they do not spawn on pawns. These can be disabled.

## Options
### Mod Settings
- Anime Hair Color Variety
> Adjusts the commonality of hair color genes so colors like teal are more common. With this mod's hair colors active, more vibrant hair colors will be in the rotation. Realistic hair colors are still favored but to a much lower degree than vanilla.
- Anime Eye Color Variety (requires EyeGenes2 and SpawnThoseGenes)
> Changes the eye color pool from EyeGenes2 using SpawnThoseGenes in a similar fashion to Anime Hair Color Variety. Requires both to be installed.
- Better SpawnThoseGenes Integration For Vanilla Xenotypes (requires SpawnThoseGenes)
> Pawns will spawn with only one hair/skintone from their xenotype's genepool just like baseliners.
- Remove Extra Hair Colors
> Removes all hair colors added by this mod.

### Tweaks
#### Highmates
- Highmates Are Capable of Violence
> Removes the violence disabled gene and replaced it with dead calm, terrible melee, terrible shooting, and weak melee.
- Lovely Feline Highmates (requires AFU Cosmetic Gene Expanded)
> Adds the lovely cat ears and tail genes from AFU Cosmetic Gene Expanded to highmates.
- Standard Body Highmates

#### Piggers
- Butchering Piggers Yields Pork (requires EBSG Framework)
- Standard Body Piggers

#### Remove Xenotypes
> For xenotypes without their own faction, these settings remove the xenotypes from factions and pawnkinddefs (including from mods). The xenotype can still be selected during game start and in the xenotype editor, but should not show up in game (barring some extremely rare circumstances). For xenotypes with factions, it also removes the faction from the game entirely. Removing wasters will always throw a red error (Failed to find RimWorld.FactionDef named PirateWaster). This error can be ignored without issue.

- Remove Impid Faction and Pawns
- Remove Neanderthal Faction and Pawns
